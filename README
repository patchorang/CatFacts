Better inform you friends about cats. Use your Google Voice number to send periodic cat facts.

https://github.com/korylprince/pygvoicelib is required
clone from: git@github.com:korylprince/pygvoicelib.git
Requires some setup through google, view the README for pygvoicelib for more info.

Usage:
from catfacts import CatFacts
cat_facts = CatFacts(username, apppass, auth_token, rnr_se, phone_number, minutes_per_text, audio_alerts)
cat_facts.goFacts();

Default catfact speed is one fact every hour. I am not sure what the SMS limits are, but they do exist.
